TwitterIntents
==============

A replacement for the Twitter Intents library[1] for those that don't need
widget creation or event support. This will open all Twitter intent urls
in a popup window, that's it.

* Works in all modern browsers and IE8.
* Works with AMD loaders.
* Not dependant on external dependancies (Twitter.com).

Usage
-----

Include the script in your webpage:

    <script src="js/twitter-intents.js"></script>

Then create a new instance and call the register method to start listening for clicks:

    var intents = new TwitterIntents().register();

Add twitter intent links to your page, these will be opened in a popup window:

    <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet">Tweet about us!</a>

If you need to remove the events the `unregister` method will do this:

    intents.unregister();

Dependencies
------------

This script has no external dependancies.

Development
-----------

It's very simple, hack on the code, ensure the lint and tests pass and submit
a pull request. Rinse and repeat.

To install the developer packages you'll need node and npm installed on your
machine. Then run:

    $ npm install

To run the linter:

    $ npm run-script lint

Production
----------

To produce a concatenated build run:

    $ npm run-script build

This will produce a minified version of the script for production use.

Testing
-------

The entire test suite is run on Travis CI on each push you can check the current
state at any time by visiting: https://travis-ci.org/BrandwatchLtd/twitter-intents

To run the suite locally using phantomjs[1] run:

    $ npm test

Alternatively tests can be run in the browser:

    $ npm start

And open the browser at http://localhost:8080/test/index.html.

Finally there are integration tests that can be run manually by running the
server and visiting the integration page: http://localhost:8080/test/integration.html.

### Writing specs

These should be placed in the test directory and the filename should
be the module name ending with `-test.js`.

### Libraries

- Mocha[1]: Test runner, we use the `bdd` style.
- Sinon[2]: Mocking and stubbing library.
