Development
-----------

To install the developer packages you'll need node and npm installed on your
machine. Then run:

    $ npm install

Create a new branch with a relevant name (lowercase and use dashes to seperate words).
Make your changes to the code, writing tests as you go. To run the test suite you
can use the command:

    $ npm test

Tests can be found in the tests directory, one per file, see the README for more
information.

All the code must pass linting. To run the linter:

    $ npm run-script lint

The rules are included in the jshint.json file in the root of the project.
